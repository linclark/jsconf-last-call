And they are actually easier to understand than you might think. So let's take a quick whirlwind tour through them.<br /><br />The first of these was Flux. I want to start with the kernel of an idea that was the core of Flux and has carried on in part to both Redux and Relay. ">

Don't worry if you don't understand it... this whole project started because I couldn't make sense of this diagram.<br /><br />Once you understand Flux, this diagram is very clear. But when you're fresh and completely new to Flux, it just looks like any other box and arrow diagram. So let me start with the problem that flux is trying to solve, and then we'll come back to this diagram. <br /><br />Flux and React both come out of Facebook. They were developed side by side to address a particular set of problems that Facebook was seeing.">

        <Slide transition={["fade"]} notes="They'd fix it, and then it would come back again. So they wanted to fix it once and for all and end the cycle.<br /><br />When they looked at it, they realized that the source of the problems... the thing that was making it so unpredictable, was the way they were handling data.">
          <Image src={fluxImages.facebook_cycle} />
        </Slide>
        <Slide transition={["fade"]} notes="They had models. Those models would pass data to the views, which would format it.<br /><br />The view also provided the user interface, so it would collect data.">
          <Image src={fluxImages.model_view1} />
        </Slide>
        <Slide transition={["fade"]} notes="And the data needed to go back to the model. So you had views updating models.<br /><br />and sometimes a change in one model makes for a change in another...">
          <Image src={fluxImages.model_view2} />
        </Slide>
        <Slide transition={["fade"]} notes="so you have models updating models. All in all, this starts to look like an epic game of pong. It's hard to figure out where the ball is going to land.<br /><br />Throw in the fact that these updates could be triggered asynchronously, so a change could trigger 2 or more other changes happening concurrently. Which is kind of like taking a bag full of ping pong balls and throwing it into your pong game.<br /><br />Facebook wanted to make this more predictable. They wanted to make it easy to figure out what effects a user interaction would have. And Flux was the way they did that.">

What it's showing you is a unidirectional data flow... the data is only going in one direction. But if you don't already understand what the parts do, I don't think this diagram helps you really get it. It definitely didn't help me.<br /><br />What did help me understand Flux was thinking about it as a group of characters, working together as a team to complete some task. So I'm going to introduce you to the cast of characters in my head.">

The View comes to it when it wants to send a message out to the rest of the system. ><br/><br/>The action creator takes the information the view gives it and formats it in a way the rest of the system can understand. Each change that the view wants to make... the action creator turns into an object that represents that change. That object has a type... for example, MESSAGE_CREATE or MESSAGE_READ, and a payload which contains the data. You define a list of action types that your system knows how to handle. The neat thing about this is that that list provides an API of all possible state changes. > <br /><br />......Once it has formatted this, the action creator sends the action off to the dispatcher.">

One way that the Flux dispatcher is different is that it sends the action to every store. > <br /><br />In a lot of other systems, you can register for a single type of event, but in Flux the dispatcher just sends it to every one.

Redux is a lot like Flux with just a couple of changes....... but if Flux solved the problem, why change it? The guy who created it wanted to make it faster to develop. The changes he made to Flux help with more than just this use case, but I think this is a good one for illustrating them.<br /><br />He had seen two cool debugging techniques in other communities and wanted to bring them to React.

          <Image src={reduxImages.hotreload5} width="1000px" />
        </Slide>
        <Slide transition={["fade"]} notes="but you don't have to reload the object that has the state. This helps you debug things faster because you don't have to reproduce the state between different attempts.<br /> <br />Time travel debugging is kind of similar.">

        <Slide transition={["fade"]} notes="through this state. So you can make your change and step back a step to try it again.<br /><br />So what do you need to do to make this work? You can actually kind of see it already in the way I've drawn this. You treat it like an equasion. You take the old state and add the action and get the *new* state. I stress 'new' here because that's the key. You don't make changes to the old state. You output a new object. This is what people talk about with immutability or pure functions.<br /><br />Redux makes it possible for you to do both of these.">

You'll remember, this is what we needed to do to support hot reloading.<br /><br />It does another thing. Instead of making changes to the state itself, instead the reducer makes a copy of the state.

        <Slide transition={["fade"]} notes="The view gets notified when state is ready and pulls data down. The thing that does this is kind of like Redux's view layer binding. It automates a lot of the work for you. Unlike Flux and Redux, this sets up an observer. But Relay manages this for you, so you don't have to manage the complexity.">
